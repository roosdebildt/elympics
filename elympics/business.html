				    	<h3>Who are the users?</h3>
				    	<p>Our targeted user group is manifold: Olympics enthusiasts, tourists as well as Berliners share an interest for the E-lympics. In common, these users have a passion for sports and technology.</p>
               
                        <h3>The key partners.</h3>
                        <p>The most crucial partner for the E-lympics is the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the governing body of the Olympic Games. Without them, such an event is not feasible, since the athletes would have to wear cameras and other tracking gadgets and the data gathered would need to be broadcasted to the BrainBox. Also, athletes would have to agree to the tracking of their performances. Another key partner is the city of Berlin, which could provide the infrastructure for the event, while promoting the city as a destination for both tourism and business.</p>

                        <p>Partnerships with telecom companies will be vital to supply equipment not only to track the athletes during the tournaments but also to record and broadcast the footage. Additional key partners for merchandising and marketing purposes are healthcare and sports brands, fitness companies, as well as celebrities and the media.</p>

                        <h3>It's all about the money.</h3>
                        <p>Despite the headline,the E-lympics are not about making profit, but about connecting people through sports and technology. However, unlike the Olympic Games, the E-lympics are much less capital intensive. In fact the E-lympics will be sustainable in the sense that the revenue streams will cover the costs. The main revenue streams of the E-lympics will be franchising, ticketing and merchandising.</p>
                        <p>We’ve calculated the costs for the initial pilot in Berlin with recording, broadcasting, 5x BrainBoxes, 10x Person Organisation team at roughly 1.3 mill €. Through hardware and technology sponsorships these costs could be cut drastically. Also any subsequent E-lympics would be less cost intensive because the system would already be established.</p>
