				    	<h3>Don’t watch it, feel it!</h3>
				    	<p>Imagine being in the centre of a football stadium and looking around at the cheering crowd.  Imagine hearing the overwhelming noise produced at the bleachers and feeling the accelerating beat of your heart. Now notice how the your breathing gets heavier as you run the first few meters of the match in a desperate attempt to steal the ball from your opponent. Feel also the impact in your chest after bumping into another player and falling heavily on the ground.</p>

				    	<p>All these experiences can actually be transmitted from the athletes to the viewers. The heart beat, breathing rhythms and even the physical impact experienced by players can be tracked by wearables, such as small devices placed on the athletes’ backs and high tech T-shirts, loaded with sensors. Their movements can be captured by small cameras placed on the player’s body and around the field. All this data can be sent in real time to fans equipped with special shirts and virtual reality glasses. This concept is not a vision of the future, these technologies already exist and are being constantly improved.</p>

                        <p>Here you can take a look at what is out there:</p>

                        <h3>On your marks, get set, go!</h3>
                        <p>What if you want to take one step further and actually compete in the Olympics? That would be possible in a virtual world. Video games already allow players to explore virtual scenarios with their whole bodies and not just with their fingertips. With treadmills, for example, users can walk, run, jump and rotate 360 degrees while wearing virtual reality glasses to observe the landscape around them.</p>

                        <p>In the E-lympics, users would be invited to mirror the real Olympics competition, running 500 meters, boxing and even fencing against each other in the virtual world. Viewers would be able to watch the games in giant screens, in a manner similar to how crowds follow eSports (electronic sports) today.</p>
