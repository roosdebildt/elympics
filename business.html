				    	<h3>Who are the users?</h3>
				    	<p>Our targeted user group is manifold: Olympics enthusiasts, tourists as well as Berliners share an interest for the E-lympics. In common, these users have a passion for sports and technology.</p>
               
                        <h3>The key partners</h3>
                        <p>The most crucial partner for the E-lympics is the <a href="//www.olympic.org/ioc">International Olympic Committee</a>, the governing body of the Olympic Games. Without it, such an event is not feasible, since the athletes would have to wear cameras and the data gathered would be broadcast to the BrainBox. Also, athletes would need to agree to having their performances tracked. Another key partner is the city of Berlin, which could provide the infrastructure for the event, while promoting the city as a destination for both tourism and business.</p>

                        <p>Partnerships with telecom companies will be vital to supply equipment not only to track the athletes during the tournaments but also to record and broadcast the footage. Additional key partners for merchandising and marketing purposes are healthcare and sports brands, fitness companies, as well as celebrities and the media.</p>
