				    	<h3>The challenge.</h3>
				    	<p>We are a multidisciplinary and international team of tech enthusiasts at the Startup Institute Berlin. In early March 2015, we received a challenge from Berlin Partner, a public-private partnership that supports companies, investors and scientific institutions in Berlin. Our task was to develop a concept to promote the city as a tech hub in the 2024 Olympics Games. There was only one rule: the job had to be done in 60 hours.</p>

                        <h3>Our vision.</h3>
                        <p>In 2015 Berlin was given the chance to host the 2024 Olympics. Together with Hamburg, Berlin applied to represent Germany in an international competition for the championship. However, locals did not seem too excited about it: half of the population was against hosting the event. Recently, the Olympic Games have become more and more unpopular, due to it ever-increasing costs and its legacy of white elephants.</p>
                        <p>The Olympics, however, are still the world's foremost sports competition and a main symbol of human development and friendly competition. Its original values, inspired in Ancient Greece, are still there, but how could they be revived?</p>
                        <p>We found the answer in technology. With the use of smart gadgets, the Games could become a more inclusive and immersive experience at a relatively low budget. According to our business model, the project would be financed by partners - which, in turn, would have access to an unique marketing platform.</p>
                        <p>Berlin is not hosting the traditional Olympics, but it is the perfect place for the E-lympics. Known as the the tech hub of Europe, it is the headquarter of hundreds of creative startups. With its culture of trial and error, the city is a big beta version, always looking for the next disruption. Why not aim at the worldâ€™s most emblematic sport event?</p>

                        <h3>Meet the team.</h3>
